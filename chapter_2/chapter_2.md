* internal vs external script
* alert();  - this is statement and semicolon 
            is marking
            end of it
* console
* let - can be change
* const - not can be change

* camel case - mean looks like camel :)  
* comments - //, /* */ single vs multi line comments
* data types: 
    * number, streang, boolean,
    * null - set a variable with no real  value || we set it to null
    * undefined - similar with null , both is empty values but 
                 || auto set that is empty
    * object - everything in JS is an Object 
    * symbol - used with objects, later will be explain

            JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you 
            don't have to specify what type of information will 
            be stored in a variable in advance. ...
