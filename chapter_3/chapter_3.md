Section 3: Control Flow Basics

     What is Control Flow?

* Looping vs Conditionals - is control flow
* A loop is a type of control flowing in JS
* conditional statement
  

     For Loops

* semicolon dont need
* {} - code block
* let i = 0 - like counter how many times we run the code inside the loop
* i < 5 - condition true || false
* i++ - her code block bitdiyinde bu bir elave daha daha edir ve condition true oldugu muddetce Loop davam edir
* I++ - code block executed olduqdan sonra calisir
* arrays.length - as like as condition when we dont no how many data have
* cycling through array as iteration
* each iteration is one cycle through
* code block bir defe calishmasi bir iteration data-dir  
    
    
     While Loops
* same with loop
* only difference is syntax
* while loop - once loopdan kendarda counter deyisken yaradilmalidir.
* code block-un icinde sonda i++ yazirirq
